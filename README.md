Overview
========

The following will present how to switch between, Earth-Centered-Earth-Fixed (ECEF), Earth-Centered-Inertial (ECI), and Topographic (longitude/latitude/altitude)
coordinates frames. These tools are helpful to perform groundtracks of space/aerial assets, determine orbital elements from position/velocity and vice versa,
perform spacecraft/aircraft visibility check when object is tracked from a ground station, size link budgets for communication purposes, and so forth.
